# Directory Cleanup Application with AI Integration

## Enhanced Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **AI Integration**
   - Interactive directory navigation
   - Safety validation
   - Contextual recommendations
   - Response caching for performance

2. **Caching System**
   - AI response caching
   - Directory statistics caching
   - Configurable cache expiration
   - Automatic cache cleanup

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Structured log organization
   - AI interaction logging
   - Operation tracking
   - Error monitoring

### Directory Structure

The application uses a well-organized directory structure:

```
directory_cleanup/
├── core/           # Core functionality
├── utils/          # Utility modules
├── strategies/     # Cleanup strategies
├── logs/           # Structured logs
├── cache/          # Cache storage
└── tests/          # Test suite
```

### Caching Strategy

1. **AI Response Caching**
   - Cache frequently used AI responses
   - Reduce API calls
   - Improve response time
   - Configurable expiration

2. **Directory Analysis Cache**
   - Cache directory statistics
   - Speed up repeated operations
   - Reduce system load
   - Auto-invalidation on changes

### Logging Strategy

1. **AI Interactions**
   - Record all AI conversations
   - Track safety recommendations
   - Monitor decision patterns
   - Audit trail for operations

2. **Operation Logs**
   - Detailed operation tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Success/failure statistics

### Testing Strategy
